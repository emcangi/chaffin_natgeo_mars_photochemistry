# chaffin_natgeo_mars_photochemistry
Julia code to run photochemical models of the Mars atmosphere for a Nature Geoscience paper.

Note: This code does not work with the current version of Julia, due to changes in the ways arrays were indexed in version 0.5 . Please run this code in version 0.4.7 or earlier. Or fix the indexing, I'm a readme not a cop.
